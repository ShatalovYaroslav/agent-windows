  <para>
  The ProActive Windows Agent is a Windows Service which is able to  create a ProActive computational node on the current machine. This node will  be provided as a computational resource to ProActive applications (such as  ProActive Scheduler&amp;Resource Manager or ProActive P2P Network) according to a user  defined schedule.  A tray icon shows the state of the agent and allows the user to start  it, stop it, or change its schedule. The ProActive Windows Agent does not interfere with the day-to-day usage of the desktop Windows machine.
 Prerequisites:
 .Net framework v2.0 or later should be installed on your system.
If it is not, the installer will ask you to install it. Go to www.microsoft.com/downloads and download Microsoft .NET Framework Version 2.0 (or later) Redistributable Package.
Visual C++ 2008 (or later)  Redistributable Package needs to be installed on your computer. The installer will install the packages if not found. The agent also needs
a Java and a ProActive installation.

<section xml:id="PA_Agent_Usage"><info><title>Usage</title></info>

<para>
Launch the Agent Control program or click on the notify icon if the "Automatic Launch" is activated.
You can edit the configuration file in order to set-up configuration parameters. A GUI for editing is provided. 
</para>
</section>
 
 <section xml:id="PA_Agent_Config"><info><title>Configuration</title></info>

  <para>The configuration file is composed of several sections</para>

  <section xml:id="PA_Agent_Config_Events"><info><title>Events</title></info>
 
    <para>
    A ProActive Runtime will be started by the agent when an Event occurs. In the configuration of the Agent we can set Calendar Events 
     which specify the time when the Runtime should be launched as well
      as the lifetime of the Runtime. The agent will stop the Runtime and the processes started by it when the time has expired. 
    </para>
    <para> For defining an event, we specify:</para>
    <itemizedlist>
      <listitem><para>Day of the week, hour, minute, and seconds when the Event occurs. The system assumes that the Events are recurring every week.</para></listitem>
    <listitem><para>The lifetime of the Event in  days, hours, minutes, and seconds.</para></listitem>
    </itemizedlist>

  </section>

 <section xml:id="PA_Agent_Config_Actions"><info><title>Actions</title></info>

    <para>An "Action" is the activity that will be initiated by the Agent during duration of an Event. Only one action can be specified for a particular Event
    (i.e. The agent will execute the same action each time the Event occurs).
    </para>
    <para>There are three types of actions:</para>
  <itemizedlist>
    <listitem><para>
    AdvertAction - starts a local ProActive Node and registers (advertises) it in a local RMI registry. The name of the node can be specified (optionally).
    </para></listitem>
    <listitem><para>
    RMAction  - starts a local ProActive Node and registers it in a Resource Manager. The URL of the ResourceManager where the node is to be registered has to be specified.
    </para></listitem>
    <listitem><para>
    P2PAction - starts a local peer and joins the Peer-To-Peer network.
		One must define a set of "first contact? peers" (by their URLs).
    </para></listitem>
  </itemizedlist>
  <note> <para>A priority can be defined for each action. This is the priority for the Windows process launched by the Agent and for all its children processes. 
  </para>
  </note>
   </section>
  <section xml:id="PAAgent_screensaver"><info><title>ProActive Agent Screensaver</title></info>
   <para>
  The ProActive screensaver will send a message to the WindowsAgent through 
   the (Windows Service) when it is launched (when the screensaver appears on the
    screen of the user). The agent will start a ProActive runtime at this moment. 
      A message will also be sent when the screensaver is stopped which 
will cause the agent to stop the Runtime.  (see 'conflicts solving bellow")
