Ant targets added

 clean              Deletes the generated files
 compile.doc.utils  Compile Documentation Utils
 jar.doc.utils      Builds a jar containing the documentation java helper classes
 toolchain          Builds and copies the toolchain in ./built                   

The DocBook folder has been removed and replaced with a zip archive containing the files.
The java class files are now supplied as  lib/doc-utils.jar instead being built when building
the documentation. The "src" folder (java files) has been removed from the built toolchain as
is now longer necessary.
